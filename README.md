# altschoolAfrica-exam-project
Github Portfolio is an application built and designed by Chibuokem Egbuchulam as a second semester exam project for Altschool Africa.

The application, built on Reactjs utilizes github APIs that display details of my github profile and repositories as well as APIs that allow you search for  other github users.

Visitors to the webpage can perform a search for these github users and navigate to their respective github profile.

I utililized react libraries like react-icons for icons, axios for API fetches, styled-components for styling, framer-motion for animation, react-router-dom for routing, react-helmet-async for SEO optimisation.
