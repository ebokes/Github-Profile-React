# Github Profile React

## Introduction

Github Profile React is a web application built with React that allows you to search for Github users and view their profiles. The application uses the Github API to retrieve user data and displays it in a clean and organized manner. 

## Tools used in achieving this application

- React
- Axios
- Github API
- React-icons for icons
- Axios for API fetches
- Styled-components for styling, 
- Framer-motion for animation
- React-router-dom for routing
- React-helmet-async for SEO optimisation.

## How I achieved this

- I started by setting up the React environment using create-react-app. 
- Then, I used Axios to make API calls to the Github API and retrieve user data. 
- I used React components to organize the UI and display the data in a user-friendly way.

## How the app works

- You are presented with the homepage and can choose to navigate to my profile where you get to see my profile and repositories, all fetched from the github API
- You could also navigate to the search user page, enter a Github username in the search bar and click the search button.
- The app will make an API call to the Github API and retrieve the user's information. 
- A list of cards will be shown, containing user's profile picture, name and link to their github profile on the github website

## Why I built the project this way

- I built the project this way to make it easy to use and understand.
- By using React components to organize the UI, I was able to make the information clear and accessible. 
- Using Axios to make API calls allowed me to retrieve the data quickly and efficiently, and the Github API provided all the necessary information to build the app.

## If I had more time I would change this

If I had more time, 
- I would add more features to the app, such as the ability to sort repositories by different criteria (e.g. number of stars, date created, etc.), and the ability to view a user's followers and following. 
- I would also improve the UI to make it more visually appealing and responsive on different devices.
