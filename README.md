# altschoolAfrica-exam-project
Github Portfolio is an application built and designed by Chibuokem Egbuchulam as a second semester exam project for Altschool Africa.

The application, built in React js utilizes github APIs that displays details of my github profile and repositories.

Visitors to the webpage can also perform a search for other github users and navigate to the respective github profile.

I also utililized libraries like react-icons for icons, axios for API fetches, styled-components for styling, react-router-dom for routing, react-helmet-async for SEO optimisation.
